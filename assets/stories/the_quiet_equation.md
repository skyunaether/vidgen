Music: warm acoustic strings, soft piano motifs, light hand percussion, and a subtle electronic pad that underscores curiosity and steady progress

## Scene 1 (10s, image)
Narration: He arrives at school carrying a backpack full of questions and a small, stubborn silence.
Visual: A 12-year-old boy sitting alone at the back of a bright middle-school classroom, late-morning with posters about math and literature, soft natural light through tall windows, warm highlights, tentative introspective mood, medium wide shot from slightly above, shallow depth of field focusing on the boy

## Scene 2 (9s, image)
Narration: Tests say he's "behind"; his teacher sees a pattern of curiosity tangled with confusion.
Visual: A female teacher reviewing a tablet frowning then softening, cluttered teacher's desk with student work and a coffee mug, warm desk lamp mixed with daylight, gentle contrast, concerned but hopeful mood, close-up on hands and tablet screen, over-the-shoulder angle

Narration: They introduce a quiet companion — an adaptive learning assistant that listens, explains, and remembers.
Visual: Animated interface projected on a classroom whiteboard interacting with the student, classroom during a small-group session, even classroom light with a subtle glow from the projection, curious collaborative mood, slow tracking shot from student to screen, medium shot, gentle camera movement showing interaction

## Scene 4 (10s, image)
Narration: The AI maps his mistakes into stories, turning abstract rules into pictures he can hold.

## Scene 5 (8s, video)
Narration: A small breakthrough — a problem that once shut him down now opens like a door.
Visual: The boy solving a math problem aloud with eyes widening and classmates smiling, classroom whiteboard with his solution written in marker, warm backlight creating a halo effect, triumphant tender mood, handheld close-up on the boy's face, quick cut to his hand writing the final step

## Scene 6 (12s, image)
Narration: The teacher learns too — the AI surfaces patterns she never had time to see, freeing her to teach the child, not the test.
Visual: Teacher and AI dashboard on a laptop showing individualized progress graphs, empty classroom after school with chairs stacked, golden hour through blinds with reflective highlights on the screen, reflective empowered mood, medium shot from behind the teacher, screen visible, soft bokeh

## Scene 7 (10s, image)
Narration: Months later, he raises his hand not to hide a mistake but to offer an idea; the room leans in.
