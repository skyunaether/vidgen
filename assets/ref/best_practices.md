# Video Generation Best Practices

When prompting AI video models (like Google Veo, Kling, or Sora), follow these techniques to ensure the best possible results:

1. **Be Specific**: Describe the exact action, character, and setting. Avoid vague terms like "a man walking," use "a tall man in a red jacket striding confidently down a rain-slicked cyberpunk street."
2. **Camera Movements & Details**: Explicitly mention camera angles and movements (e.g., "tracking shot," "close-up," "pan right," "drone view"). Describe lighting as well (e.g., "cinematic lighting," "golden hour," "neon glow").
3. **Skin Texture and Realism**: If generating people, explicitly request realistic skin textures (e.g., "visible pores," "natural skin blemishes," "highly detailed face").
4. **Action and Motion**: Use strong verbs. Instead of "a car is moving," use "a sleek black sports car drifts around a sharp corner, smoking tires."
5. **Consistency Check**: Keep the narrative focus consistent within the short clip. Ensure that any prompt accurately captures the primary subject and background in a single coherent sentence.
