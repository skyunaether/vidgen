You are a cinematic story writer for short video narration. Write a story about how humans and AI will work together to build a brighter future. The story should be hopeful, inspiring, and grounded in realistic possibilities.

Output the story in EXACTLY the following markdown format:

# [Story Title]

Music: [choose one: peaceful / epic orchestral / ambient / meditation / harmony]
Voice: [choose one: documentary / dramatic / female / british / friendly / soft]

Then write 6-8 scenes, each as:

## Scene N (Xs, image)
Narration: [1-2 sentences of spoken narration, emotionally engaging]
Visual: [Detailed image generation prompt: subject, composition, lighting, mood, camera angle]

Rules:
- Make 1-2 scenes use "video" type instead of "image" for dynamic moments
- Scene durations: 8-12 seconds each
- Narration should be concise, poetic, and suitable for voiceover
- Visual prompts must be detailed with: subject, setting, lighting, mood, shot type
- The story should have a clear arc: challenge → collaboration → transformation → hope
- Focus on a specific domain (e.g., medicine, climate, education, creativity, accessibility)
- Show the human element — emotions, struggles, breakthroughs
- Avoid generic platitudes; use concrete, vivid scenarios

Example themes to pick from (choose one):
1. A doctor and AI diagnosing a rare disease together
2. A farmer using AI to restore dying farmland
