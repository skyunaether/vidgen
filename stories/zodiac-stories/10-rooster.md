## Scene 1 (8s, image)
Narration: Before the Rooster existed, sunrise was not guaranteed. Each night, darkness tried to hold on — stretching thicker, heavier, refusing to release the world.
Visual: A world trapped in unnatural extended darkness, people huddled around dying fires, withered crops, an oppressive black sky pressing down, bleak and suffocating, wide atmospheric shot

## Scene 2 (10s, image)
Narration: The sun was not lazy. It was fighting. Every dawn was a battle against an ancient darkness that predated even the gods.
Visual: A blazing sun struggling to push through a wall of living darkness, tendrils of shadow wrapping around it, cosmic battle at the horizon, epic scale, dramatic contrast of light and dark

## Scene 3 (10s, image)
Narration: The Jade Emperor needed a herald — a creature whose voice could pierce the boundary between night and day.
Visual: The Jade Emperor standing at the edge of heaven looking down at the dark world, hand outstretched searching, celestial figures behind him, worried expressions, dramatic heavenly vista

## Scene 4 (10s, image)
Narration: Many animals auditioned. The Wolf's howl was haunting. The Crane's call was beautiful. The Lion's roar scared the sun itself.
Visual: Animals lined up performing their calls — wolf howling, crane singing, lion roaring — sound waves visualized in different colors, none quite right, celestial audition stage, dramatic lighting

## Scene 5 (10s, video)
Narration: Then the Rooster sang. Its crow was not beautiful. It was sharp, certain, and absolutely unwavering. It cut through darkness like a blade.
Visual: A magnificent red rooster standing on a high rock, crowing with intense power, its call visualized as a golden shockwave slicing through black darkness, dramatic burst of energy

## Scene 6 (12s, video)
Narration: The sun heard it and surged forward. Dawn broke clean and golden for the first time in centuries.
Visual: The sun bursting through the darkness as the rooster's call reaches it, golden light flooding across the landscape, darkness shattering like glass, triumphant and glorious sunrise, epic wide shot

## Scene 7 (10s, image)
Narration: The Rooster has never missed a single morning. Not once in ten thousand years. While the world sleeps, it stands alone in the dark.
Visual: Rooster standing alone on a fence post in pre-dawn darkness, the entire world asleep behind it, a tiny silhouette against the vast dark sky, solitary duty, moody atmospheric shot

## Scene 8 (8s, image)
Narration: Tomorrow morning, listen. That's not just a bird. That's the sound of darkness losing.
Visual: Glorious sunrise breaking over a Chinese countryside, a rooster silhouetted and crowing on a rooftop, first golden rays spreading across the land, triumphant and beautiful, cinematic wide shot
