## Scene 1 (8s, image)
Narration: Every creature in the zodiac can be found in nature — except the Dragon. Not because it doesn't exist. Because it chose to disappear.
Visual: Silhouette of a massive dragon dissolving into clouds and mist above a mountain range, scales turning transparent, mysterious and grand, cinematic wide shot

## Scene 2 (10s, image)
Narration: In the age before the zodiac, the Dragon was the most visible being alive. It commanded storms, parted oceans, and kings begged for its blessing.
Visual: A magnificent golden dragon coiling above a stormy ocean, lightning crackling around its body, ancient Chinese warships below flying dragon banners, epic dramatic lighting

## Scene 3 (10s, image)
Narration: But the Dragon noticed something troubling. The more it appeared, the more people worshipped its power instead of finding their own.
Visual: Crowds of people kneeling and praying to a dragon in the sky while their unbuilt houses and untended fields sit abandoned behind them, contrast between worship and neglect, muted tones

## Scene 4 (10s, image)
Narration: Villages stopped building shelters. Warriors stopped training. They believed the Dragon would always save them.
Visual: Crumbling village walls and idle warriors sitting beneath a dragon-shaped cloud, dependency and decay, melancholic atmosphere, overcast grey light

## Scene 5 (12s, video)
Narration: So the Dragon went to the Jade Emperor with an unusual request — "Let me become invisible. Let me exist in clouds, in thunder, in the spaces between raindrops."
Visual: Dragon kneeling before the Jade Emperor in a celestial palace, its body beginning to shimmer and fade, golden particles drifting from its scales, dramatic heavenly light

## Scene 6 (12s, video)
Narration: The Emperor granted the wish. The Dragon dissolved — its spine became mountain ranges, its breath became monsoons, its heartbeat the pulse of the earth.
Visual: Dragon's body transforming and merging into landscape — spine becoming mountain ridges, breath becoming wind and rain, body dissolving into rivers and valleys, epic transformation sequence

## Scene 7 (10s, image)
Narration: Now the Dragon influences everything while appearing as nothing. True power doesn't demand attention.
Visual: A serene Chinese mountain landscape with subtle dragon shapes hidden in the clouds, rivers, and ridgelines, the viewer must look closely to see the dragon everywhere, beautiful hidden pattern

## Scene 8 (8s, image)
Narration: The Dragon is everywhere. That's why you can't see it.
Visual: A single raindrop falling into a still pond, creating ripples that form a faint dragon shape in the water's surface, minimalist and profound, close-up macro shot, soft light
