## Scene 1 (8s, image)
Narration: There was a time when humans could not dream. Sleep was just a small death, repeated nightly — no visions, no stories, no hope.
Visual: Humans sleeping in dark empty blackness, no color, no dreams above their heads, bleak and hollow atmosphere, muted grey tones, wide overhead shot

## Scene 2 (10s, image)
Narration: The Jade Emperor worried. Without dreams, humans had no imagination. The world was becoming grey.
Visual: The Jade Emperor looking down at a colorless grey earth from his celestial palace, concern on his face, contrast between the vibrant heavens and the dull world below

## Scene 3 (10s, image)
Narration: He called upon the Goat — the gentlest creature in heaven — and gave it a loom made of moonbeams and spider silk.
Visual: A serene white goat receiving a shimmering ethereal loom from the Emperor, the loom glowing with silver moonlight and gossamer threads, celestial workshop setting, magical atmosphere

## Scene 4 (12s, video)
Narration: Each night, the Goat weaves. It pulls a thread of memory here, a thread of desire there, a strand of fear, a ribbon of hope.
Visual: The goat working at the magical loom, pulling colorful glowing threads from the air — blue memories, red desires, dark fears, golden hopes — weaving them into shimmering tapestries, beautiful and intricate

## Scene 5 (10s, image)
Narration: No two dreams are ever the same. But hidden in every one is a single golden thread of meaning.
Visual: A stunning dream tapestry floating above a sleeping person, intricate patterns with one visible golden thread woven throughout, warm glowing colors, overhead close-up shot

## Scene 6 (10s, image)
Narration: Those who notice the golden thread — artists, poets, healers — wake up with something burning in their chest. An idea. A song. A solution.
Visual: A painter waking up at dawn with glowing golden light in their eyes, immediately reaching for a brush, dream fragments dissolving around them, inspired and urgent, warm morning light

## Scene 7 (10s, image)
Narration: But the Goat absorbs fragments of every dream it weaves. It carries the nightmares of millions — processing humanity's darkness so they don't have to.
Visual: The goat sitting alone in its meadow between dimensions, dark shadowy nightmare fragments swirling around it being absorbed into its wool, bittersweet and sacrificial, moody ethereal lighting

## Scene 8 (8s, image)
Narration: Tonight, when you dream, know that something gentle made it for you.
Visual: Peaceful sleeping person with a beautiful colorful dream blossoming above their head, the faint silhouette of the goat visible within the dream clouds, warm and comforting, cinematic wide shot
