## Scene 4 (12s, video)
Narration: Death followed. Not quickly — Death never hurries — but with absolute certainty. The mist rolled across fields, over rivers, through forests.
Visual: Horse racing across vast landscapes — fields, rivers, forests — with the grey mist always visible behind, relentless and steady, aerial tracking shot, dramatic contrast of speed vs inevitability

Narration: The Horse ran for seven days and seven nights. Its hooves cracked. Its lungs screamed. But each time it slowed, it felt the cold mist brush its tail.

## Scene 7 (12s, video)
Narration: So the Horse turned around and charged directly into the mist. The impact scattered Death into a thousand fragments.
Visual: Horse charging headfirst into the wall of grey mist, explosion of light as the mist shatters into a thousand dissipating fragments, heroic slow-motion, blinding radiance

## Scene 8 (8s, image)
Narration: The Horse never asked if it could win. It only asked if the girl was safe.
Visual: The horse's constellation galloping across a brilliant night sky, the girl now old watching from below with grateful eyes, stars forming the horse's shape, beautiful and emotional, wide cinematic shot
