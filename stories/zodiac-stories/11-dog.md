## Scene 1 (8s, image)
Narration: Between the world of the living and the dead, there is a gate — not made of iron or jade, but made of loyalty itself.
Visual: A massive ethereal gate floating between two realms — one bright and living, one dark and spectral — the gate shimmering with warm golden energy, cosmic liminal space, cinematic wide shot

## Scene 2 (10s, image)
Narration: When the first human died, their soul wandered in confusion. There was no path, no guide. Souls drifted between worlds, becoming ghosts.
Visual: Lost translucent souls wandering in a foggy void between two worlds, confused expressions, some fading into ghostly forms, eerie and sorrowful, misty blue-grey atmosphere

## Scene 3 (10s, image)
Narration: The Jade Emperor needed a guardian — someone incorruptible. He tested every creature by offering them what they wanted most.
Visual: The Jade Emperor presenting glittering treasures — gold, kingdoms, power — to a line of animals, each one reaching forward tempted, dramatic celestial testing ground, warm golden light

## Scene 4 (10s, image)
Narration: He offered the Tiger gold. The Tiger took it. He offered the Dragon a kingdom. The Dragon hesitated. Every creature failed.
Visual: Tiger greedily clutching gold, Dragon reaching uncertainly toward a floating kingdom, other animals succumbing to temptation, falling one by one, dramatic sequence, disappointed heavenly light

## Scene 5 (12s, video)
Narration: The Dog was offered the one thing it wanted most — its beloved owner's soul, returned from the dead. Its master stood on the other side of the gate, calling its name.
Visual: A loyal dog standing before the gate, its deceased owner visible on the other side reaching out, the dog trembling with longing, tears in its eyes, heartbreaking emotional scene, warm and cold light split

## Scene 6 (10s, image)
Narration: Every fiber of its being screamed to open the gate. But the Dog understood — some boundaries must never be broken.
Visual: Extreme close-up of the dog's face torn between love and duty, tears streaming, jaw clenched, the ghostly hand of its master just inches away through the gate, devastating emotional portrait

## Scene 7 (10s, image)
Narration: The Dog lay down in front of the gate and refused to move. Even for love. The Emperor wept — "Yours was the cruelest test. And you are the only one who passed."
Visual: The dog lying down firmly at the base of the golden gate, resolute and heartbroken, the Jade Emperor above with tears on his face, solemn and sacred atmosphere, dramatic lighting

## Scene 8 (8s, image)
Narration: The Dog still guards the gate. Not because it doesn't love — because it loves too much to let go wrong.
Visual: The faithful dog sitting at the glowing gate for eternity, calm and watchful, souls peacefully passing through in orderly light, the dog's master's ghost gently resting a hand on its head from the other side, beautiful bittersweet, cinematic wide shot
