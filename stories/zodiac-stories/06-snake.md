## Scene 1 (8s, image)
Narration: Before the Snake had wisdom, it had hunger — an endless, gnawing hunger that nothing could satisfy.
Visual: A dark serpent coiling restlessly in shadows, eyes burning with desperate hunger, barren rocky landscape, moody dark atmosphere, close-up dramatic shot

## Scene 2 (10s, image)
Narration: One night, a falling star streaked across the sky — a fragment of pure celestial knowledge, burning white-hot.
Visual: A blazing white star falling through a dark sky leaving a brilliant trail, ancient Chinese night landscape below, the snake looking up with wide eyes, dramatic contrast of light and dark

## Scene 3 (12s, video)
Narration: Without thinking, the Snake opened its jaws and swallowed the star whole.
Visual: Snake rearing up and swallowing a brilliant ball of white celestial fire, its body illuminating from within, explosion of light from its throat, dramatic slow-motion, intense radiance

## Scene 4 (10s, image)
Narration: The pain was beyond description. For three days it lay coiled in agony, glowing from within, as the star's knowledge rewrote every cell.
Visual: Snake coiled tightly on dark ground, body pulsing with internal white and gold light, veins of starlight visible through its scales, agonized pose, ethereal glow against darkness

## Scene 5 (10s, image)
Narration: When the Snake finally rose, its eyes held the cold clarity of cosmic understanding. It could see the hidden connections between all things.
Visual: Close-up of the snake's transformed eyes — now containing swirling galaxies and star patterns within the pupils, calm and omniscient gaze, dark background, stunning detail

## Scene 6 (10s, image)
Narration: But the knowledge came with a cost. Every word it spoke carried the weight of truth — and truth, unfiltered, can destroy.
Visual: Snake speaking to a group of animals, its words visualized as sharp crystalline shards floating in the air, some animals recoiling, dramatic tension, dark mystical setting

## Scene 7 (10s, image)
Narration: So the Snake learned silence. It watched. It waited. It spoke only when silence was no longer an option.
Visual: Snake resting motionless on a moonlit branch, perfectly still, eyes observing everything, surrounded by a web of faint glowing connection lines between all living things, serene and mysterious

## Scene 8 (8s, image)
Narration: The Snake doesn't speak often. But when it does — you should listen very carefully.
Visual: Extreme close-up of the snake's face, starlight still glimmering in its eyes, mouth slightly open as if about to speak, dark background, intense and captivating, cinematic portrait
