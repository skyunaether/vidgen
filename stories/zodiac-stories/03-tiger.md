## Scene 1 (8s, image)
Narration: There was a time when the Tiger feared nothing — not fire, not flood, not even the gods themselves.
Visual: A massive tiger roaring atop a burning mountain, flames reflecting in its eyes, villages destroyed below, dark dramatic sky, powerful wide shot

## Scene 2 (10s, image)
Narration: The Jade Emperor summoned it to heaven and placed three marks upon its forehead — the character for King.
Visual: Close-up of a tiger's forehead being marked with the glowing Chinese character 王 by the Jade Emperor's finger, celestial golden light, mystical atmosphere

## Scene 3 (10s, image)
Narration: "A true king must understand what it means to lose," the Emperor said. And sent the Tiger to face three trials.
Visual: The tiger standing before three massive glowing gates in a misty void, each gate pulsing with different colored light, ominous and grand, cinematic wide shot

## Scene 4 (12s, video)
Narration: In the River of Memory, the Tiger saw every creature it had harmed — not their deaths, but their lives. Their children. Their small joys.
Visual: Tiger standing in a shallow glowing river, ghostly images of animals and their families floating around it, the tiger's expression shifting from fierce to sorrowful, ethereal blue light

## Scene 5 (10s, image)
Narration: On the Mountain of Silence, no roar could echo. For seven days, the Tiger heard only its own heartbeat — and realized it sounded like every other creature's.
Visual: Tiger sitting alone on a barren white mountain peak in absolute stillness, sound waves dissolving into nothing, minimalist stark composition, meditative atmosphere

## Scene 6 (12s, video)
Narration: In the Valley of Shadows, the Tiger fought its own reflection. Every attack was mirrored perfectly. It could only stop fighting.
Visual: Tiger lunging at a perfect shadow copy of itself in a dark mirror valley, claws meeting claws, both frozen mid-strike, dramatic symmetrical composition, dark purple lighting

## Scene 7 (10s, image)
Narration: When the Tiger returned, it was changed. Still fierce. Still powerful. But its eyes now held something new — restraint.
Visual: Close-up portrait of the tiger's face, 王 glowing softly on its forehead, eyes calm and wise instead of raging, soft golden light, painterly Chinese art style

## Scene 8 (8s, image)
Narration: The strongest thing you can do is choose not to strike.
Visual: The tiger sitting peacefully in a bamboo forest, small birds perched on its back without fear, dappled sunlight, serene and powerful, cinematic wide shot
