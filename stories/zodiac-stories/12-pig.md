## Scene 1 (8s, image)
Narration: The Pig was not always a pig. It was once a celestial general — Commander of Eighty Thousand Heavenly Sailors, robed in starlight.
Visual: A magnificent celestial warrior in gleaming armor standing on clouds, commanding ranks of heavenly soldiers, starlight cape flowing, grand and powerful, epic Chinese mythology style

## Scene 2 (10s, image)
Narration: But at a heavenly banquet, the general drank too deeply and pursued the Moon Goddess with clumsy affection. The court was scandalized.
Visual: A drunken general stumbling toward the elegant Moon Goddess at a lavish celestial banquet, other immortals gasping in shock, spilled wine, beautiful but chaotic, dramatic palace interior

## Scene 3 (10s, video)
Narration: The punishment was severe — reincarnation as the lowliest creature, stripped of all memory, all power, all dignity.
Visual: The general falling from heaven like a burning comet, armor shattering away piece by piece, body transforming mid-fall, trailing fire across the night sky, devastating descent, dramatic vertical shot

## Scene 4 (10s, image)
Narration: When it opened its eyes, it had hooves instead of hands, a snout instead of a face, and an appetite that could never be satisfied.
Visual: A confused pig lying in mud, looking at its own hooves with bewildered eyes that still hold a faint celestial spark, dirty pig pen, stark contrast to heavenly glory, emotional close-up

## Scene 5 (10s, image)
Narration: But here is the secret — the Pig remembers. Not clearly. Not names or faces. But in feelings.
Visual: Pig rolling in cool mud with an expression of unexpected bliss, faint ghostly overlay of celestial rivers superimposed, memory echoes visible as translucent golden shimmer, dreamlike double exposure

## Scene 6 (10s, image)
Narration: When it eats, it tastes shadows of heavenly feasts. When it sleeps in warmth, it remembers belonging to something divine. Every joy is homesickness for paradise.
Visual: Pig eating contentedly, with ghostly images of magnificent celestial banquet food overlaid, warm golden memories bleeding through mundane reality, bittersweet and beautiful, split reality composition

## Scene 7 (10s, image)
Narration: The Jade Emperor watches sometimes and feels guilt. The punishment was meant to humiliate. Instead, the Pig turned mud into contentment and a pen into a home.
Visual: The Jade Emperor looking down from heaven at the peaceful pig below, guilt and admiration on his face, the pig happy in its simple pen while celestial light falls on it, emotional contrast, split composition

## Scene 8 (8s, image)
Narration: The Pig closes every zodiac cycle — because paradise is always the last thing we find.
Visual: A content pig silhouetted against a stunning sunset, twelve zodiac symbols completing a circle above it with the pig in the final position, golden light, peaceful and profound, cinematic wide shot
