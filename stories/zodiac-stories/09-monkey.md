## Scene 1 (8s, image)
Narration: Heaven runs on rules. Every soul is assigned a lifespan, recorded in the Book of Life and Death — a ledger so ancient even the gods forgot who wrote it.
Visual: An enormous ancient book on a stone pedestal in a dark celestial vault, glowing characters filling its pages, chains wrapped around it, ominous and sacred, dramatic spotlight

## Scene 2 (10s, image)
Narration: The Monkey was born from a stone egg on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit — a glitch in the cosmic system. The Book had no entry for it.
Visual: A glowing stone egg cracking open on a lush mountainside covered in flowers, golden light bursting out, a small monkey emerging, magical birth scene, vibrant colors

## Scene 3 (10s, video)
Narration: When the Monkey discovered this, it didn't celebrate. Instead, it broke into the Underworld to find the Book.
Visual: Monkey sneaking through dark corridors of the Chinese underworld, past sleeping demon guards, approaching the glowing Book, shadows and red lantern light, heist atmosphere

## Scene 4 (12s, image)
Narration: What the Monkey saw horrified it. Billions of predetermined deaths. A child — age seven. A scholar who would have changed the world — age thirty-two.
Visual: The Monkey reading the Book with growing horror, pages showing names and death dates, ghostly faces of the doomed floating above the pages, tragic and disturbing, close-up dramatic lighting

## Scene 5 (10s, video)
Narration: The Monkey picked up a brush and crossed out every name it could find. Thousands of death dates — erased.
Visual: Monkey furiously striking through names in the Book with a celestial brush, ink splattering, pages glowing and flickering as fates are rewritten, frantic energy, dramatic close-up

## Scene 6 (10s, image)
Narration: Heaven erupted in chaos. The celestial bureaucracy couldn't function. The Kings of Hell filed complaints.
Visual: Celestial palace in uproar, scrolls flying, celestial officials panicking, demon kings from hell storming in waving complaint documents, chaotic heavenly courtroom scene, dramatic wide shot

## Scene 7 (10s, image)
Narration: The Emperor was furious. But the Monkey's answer echoed through philosophy forever — "If the order is wrong, it should be disrupted."
Visual: The Monkey standing defiantly before the angry Jade Emperor, golden staff in hand, unwavering expression, celestial court watching in shock, dramatic confrontation, powerful low angle

## Scene 8 (8s, image)
Narration: Every rule exists until someone brave enough decides to break it.
Visual: The Monkey imprisoned under a massive mountain, but smiling — because somewhere in the world, a child who was meant to die at seven just turned eight, split composition, bittersweet cinematic shot
